Yesterday, I coded and uploaded the hamburger menu for the mobile view.
Today, I will do code review with other colleagues to see if the menu is working as expected.
Nothing is blocking me.

Yesterday, I worked on the menu options disappearing in mobile view without removing the header bar, which was successful.
Also worked on centering the logo, but there was an issue so I did not prevail.
Today I will continue along this path and try to make the top part of the mobile look as wanted.
I am supposedly not blocked by anything.
