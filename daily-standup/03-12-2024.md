Yesterday we worked it out together and I  worked on restoring it, getting some structure and making the CSS follow the order of the HTML. I also worked on the mobile version, adding some of the CSS from the desktop version to the mobile one, and adding exceptions and changes where needed. I solved an issue in the footer where the links would jump to two different rows instead of one. Also, changed the alignment of the text, having different alignments in mobile and desktop, now it looks quite nice.
I also encountered some code for the same html block being written in three different places, I put them together under the same umbrella, making it easier to get an overview.
Today I will continue with organizing the code. There are still some issues where some code is written outside of the scope of all media queries without it being marked as being global. I am blocked by nothing.

Yesterday, I fixed the hamburger menu to make sure it was responsive, also worked together with Max to restore some bad code.
Today, I will work on the SEO for the website.
Nothing blocks me at this moment, all of us are in sync for the project
