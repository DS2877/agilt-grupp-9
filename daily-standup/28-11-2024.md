Yester I had major problems with media queries not working, because they were not properly scoped. One query for desktop was inside mobile queries, and another query was opened and closed without enclosing the whole document. Managed to figure it out and solve it. The code order was very confusing, but is now restructured. This has taken a lot of time, but now everything is set to fix the menu and header for the mobile devices. Tomorrow I will fix the header and menu for the mobile view. I am not blocked by anything (anymore).
