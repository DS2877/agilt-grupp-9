Yesterday I messed up the code and got really blocked.
Today I will work on restructuring the code and comment it to make it more clear. I am blocked by nothing.

Samir:
Yesterday I added a linear gradient and top border to the footer. A also updated some of its colors.
Today I will make the footer mobile compatible.
Nothing is blocking me.
