• What did I complete yesterday? Yesterday, I coded the div class”below-text” and added media queries for the mobile view
• What will I work on today. I will code the text area on the desktop view and add colors suggested by max to the buttons on the website.
• Am I blocked by anything? I need to do my best to complete the task today.

Samir:
Yesterday I reviewed some of the code in the header and the footer and made sure what we have so far looks good. Some things need to be added so the task was put back into the in progress section.
Today I will add social media links in the footer.
I see no hindrances and hope I will have it done by tomorrow.

Max:
Yesterday I was supposed to work on the SEO but realized it's very dependent on the content of the page, which is non-existent at the moment. Today I will add some content that can be optimized for search engines, but I think a lot of the SEO will have to wait until the final stages. If I get hindered I will take a look at the color palette.
