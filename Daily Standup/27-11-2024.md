Yesterday Samir and I worked on the hamburger menu for mobile devices. We had a major snafu that we tried to solve on our own.
After a lot of troubleshooting we asked our friend Chat GPT, and he spotted the issue. 
Our menu was in the header in HTML, but the coresponding CSS was in Main, meaning it wasn't applied to the HTML code.
After some time we solved it. We then tried to reuse some of our menu code from our previous project.
Of course this wasn't frictionless, since this had major repercursions. We realized that our task is much bigger than 
anticipated, and we will continue tomorrow, perhaps with additional help from the others.
Aside from our problems, it was fun to work together, and felt much safer to have a safety net.
