Yesterday â€“ I coded the navigation bar, added scss file to the project and tested it for proper functioning.
Today ---I will do the mobile first view for the text and footer.
Is anything blocking you ----not exactly, waiting for other colleaguesto test the code.

Samir:
Yesterday I worked on the footer and got some of it's styling done.
Today I will review some of the code already written and make sure there are no bugs.
I need to figure out how to remove the .map from automatically opening so that it's not pushed into the repo, before continuing on my daily tasks.
